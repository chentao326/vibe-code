<p align="center">
For developers who use AI coding assistants — a skill that turns every task into a calibrated experiment.

<p align="center">
You say "this task should be easy." You've said it a hundred times.<br>
How many times were you right? You don't know — because you never kept books.<br>
Vibe Code keeps them for you. One month in, your judgment has data behind it.<br>
Three months in, your prompt intuition is 10× sharper than day one.

## What it does

Most AI coding users live in the same loop:

> Prompt → AI generates → works / doesn't → wing it next time

A developer who's used AI coding for six months is barely sharper than someone on day one — because they never **retro'd** a single task.

**Vibe Code** turns every coding session into a traceable experiment:

Assess → Blind-predict → Code → Retro → Evolve your rubric

This isn't productivity theater. It's **compounding** — every task you don't retro is silently eroding your ability to see yourself.

---

## Origin

> I built a content creation toolkit that used "blind-predict → retro → evolve the formula." It took me from zero to 1M followers in a month.
>
> Then I realized: the methodology isn't content-specific. It works for any workflow that can be broken into "task → execute → retro."
>
> So I built Vibe Code. It ports the calibration engine from content creation to software engineering — assess task difficulty, predict rounds and time, settle the books after coding, and let the model evolve with your data.
>
> After three months, your guess about "how long will this take" is no longer a guess. It's data.
>
> — *ported from cheat-on-content*

## How it differs from other AI coding tools

| Other tools | Vibe Code |
|---|---|
| Write code for you | **Judge** what good code looks like |
| AI does the work | AI **assesses** the work — you still execute |
| Task done, move on | Task done is the beginning — predicted vs. actual, **deviation logged** |
| Each session is siloed | An **evolving rubric** — v1 ≠ v0, and v2 won't equal v1 |

In a sentence: other tools help you "ship faster." This helps you "judge sharper."

---

## Why the rubric actually evolves

Every completed task feeds its deviation analysis into the rubric. Three same-direction misses in a row, and the tool nudges you to upgrade the scoring formula. Upgrades require:

- Full historical rescore
- Rank consistency ≥ 80%
- Cross-model independent audit

**You're not guessing alone — the model remembers, settles, and evolves for you.**

Observations refuted by data get deleted. Observations absorbed into formal dimensions also get deleted. The rubric only holds what's most useful right now.

## Built-in Handoff Protocol

Vibe Code includes two **AI coding collaboration protocols** that bring discipline and traceability to your workflow:

| Protocol | Description | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| **codex-self-handoff** | Codex runs the full 6-phase pipeline solo (Spec→Plan→Build→Review→Polish→Commit) | "self-handoff" / "自交接" |
| **codex-claude-handoff** | Codex + Claude Code dual-tool collab (Codex builds, Claude designs + reviews) | "handoff" / "交接" |

**Fused with the calibration loop**: handoff's 6 phases anchor vibe-code's actions:

```
handoff: Spec → Plan → Build → Review → Polish → Commit
           │       │       │        │         │        │
vibe:   assess  score    —      retro      —    bump-check
```

See [handoff-vibe-bridge.md](shared-references/handoff-vibe-bridge.md).


## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chentao326/vibe-code.git
cd vibe-code
bash install.sh        # Claude Codex (default)
bash install.sh --all  # Codex + Claude Code + Cursor
```

15 sub-skills (13 vibe-code + 2 handoff) are symlinked into your agent's skill directory. One install, every project gets it.

**Supported agents**: Claude Code (default) · Codex · Cursor

> Frozen version: `bash install.sh --copy`
>
> Uninstall: `bash uninstall.sh` (your project data is not touched)

---

## First run

In your project directory, open Codex / Claude Code and say:

```
初始化 vibe-code
```

New projects go through standard 5-question onboarding. Git history is auto-detected for historical import.

Then jump straight in:

```
self-handoff — build a user login feature
```

Codex runs the full 6-phase pipeline (Spec→Plan→Build→Review→Polish→Commit), triggering vibe calibration at key checkpoints (assess → code → retro).

---

## Daily use

```
self-handoff              → full 6-phase pipeline (vibe calibration + handoff discipline)
assess tasks/xxx.md       → score + blind prediction (before coding, locked on save)
code                      → AI does the work
retro                     → auto-detects build-done, collects git data, predicted vs. actual
bump rubric               → evolve formula (needs ≥5 calibration samples)

status / find topics / recommend / trends / profile / quick score
```

With hooks installed, WIP + pending retros + bump alerts show at every session start. Full workflow: [SKILL.md](SKILL.md).

## Current status

| Metric | Value |
